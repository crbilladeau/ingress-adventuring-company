          Not only is he a professor at the prestigious University of
          Jonzenetti, he's also an experienced adventurer who has saved the
          world (more than once!). What he lacks in foresight he makes up for in
          creative magical skills, blind confidence, and the ability to get out
          of any dangerous situation! He hasn't died yet!! And you'll never be
          bored when you're working with him! In his own words, "I can do
          anything with magic!"
